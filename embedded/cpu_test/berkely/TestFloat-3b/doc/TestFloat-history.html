<H1>History of Berkeley TestFloat, to Release 3b</H1>

<P>
John R. Hauser<BR>
2016 July 22<BR>
</P>


<P>
Releases of Berkeley TestFloat normally parallel those of Berkeley SoftFloat,
on which TestFloat is based.
Each TestFloat release necessarily incorporates all bug fixes from the
corresponding release of SoftFloat.
</P>


<H3>Release 3b (2016 July)</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
Added the ability to test the common <NOBR>16-bit</NOBR>
&ldquo;half-precision&rdquo; floating-point format.

<LI>
Added a <CODE>-seed</CODE> option to programs <CODE>testfloat_gen</CODE>,
<CODE>testfloat</CODE>, and <CODE>testsoftfloat</CODE> for setting the seed for
the pseudo-random number generator used to generate test cases.

<LI>
Where a specific choice is needed for how tininess is detected on underflow,
changed the default to be the detection of tininess after rounding
(<CODE>-tininessafter</CODE>) instead of before rounding
(<CODE>-tininessbefore</CODE>).

<LI>
Modified the format of reported discrepancies to show the signs of
floating-point values using <CODE>+</CODE> and <CODE>-</CODE> characters.

<LI>
Documented the use of the <CODE>INLINE</CODE> macro, and fixed the sources for
the case that function inlining is not supported by the C compiler.

<LI>
Documented the possible need to define macro <CODE>THREAD_LOCAL</CODE> to match
how the SoftFloat library was built.

<LI>
Modified the provided Makefiles to allow some options to be overridden from the
<CODE>make</CODE> command.

</UL>


<H3>Release 3a (2015 October)</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
Replaced the license text supplied by the University of California, Berkeley,
and fixed some minor build problems.

</UL>


<H3>Release 3 (2015 February)</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
Complete rewrite, funded by the University of California, Berkeley, and
consequently having a different use license than earlier releases.
Visible changes included different names for testable functions and command
options.

<LI>
Reinstated separate programs for generating test cases
(<CODE>testfloat_ver</CODE>) and verifying test results
(<CODE>testfloat_gen</CODE>), as alternatives to the all-in-one
<CODE>testfloat</CODE> program (which remained supported).

<LI>
Added support for testing conversions between floating-point and unsigned
integers, both <NOBR>32-bit</NOBR> and <NOBR>64-bit</NOBR>.

<LI>
Added support for testing a fused multiply-add operation, for all testable
floating-point formats except <NOBR>80-bit</NOBR> double-extended-precision.

<LI>
Added support for testing a fifth rounding mode, <CODE>near_maxMag</CODE>
(round to nearest, with ties to maximum magnitude, away from zero).

<LI>
Added <CODE>timesoftfloat</CODE> (previously found in the Berkeley SoftFloat
package).

</UL>


<H3>Release 2c (2015 January)</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
Fixed mistakes affecting some <NOBR>64-bit</NOBR> processors.

<LI>
Made minor updates to the documentation, including improved wording for the
legal restrictions on using TestFloat releases <NOBR>through 2c</NOBR> (not
applicable to <NOBR>Release 3</NOBR> or later).

</UL>


<P>
There was never a <NOBR>Release 2b</NOBR>.
</P>


<H3>Release 2a (1998 December)</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
Added support for testing conversions between floating-point and
<NOBR>64-bit</NOBR> signed integers.

<LI>
Improved the Makefiles.

</UL>


<H3>Release 2 (1997 June)</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
Integrated the generation of test cases and the checking of system results into
a single program.
(Before they were separate programs, normally joined by explicit command-line
pipes.)

<LI>
Improved the sequence of test cases.

<LI>
Added support for testing <NOBR>80-bit</NOBR> double-extended-precision and
<NOBR>128-bit</NOBR> quadruple precision.

<LI>
Made program output more readable, and added new command arguments.

<LI>
Reduced dependence on the quality of the standard <CODE>rand</CODE> function
for generating test cases.
(Previously naively expected <CODE>rand</CODE> to be able to generate good
random bits for the entire machine word width.)

<LI>
Created <CODE>testsoftfloat</CODE>, with its own simpler complete software
floating-point (&ldquo;slowfloat&rdquo;) for comparison purposes.

<LI>
Made some changes to the source file structure, including renaming
<CODE>environment.h</CODE> to <CODE>milieu.h</CODE> (to avoid confusion with
environment variables).

</UL>


<H3>Release 1a (1996 July)</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
Added the <CODE>-tininessbefore</CODE> and <CODE>-tininessafter</CODE> options
to control whether tininess should be detected before or after rounding.

</UL>


<H3>Release 1 (1996 July)</H3>

<UL>

<LI>
Original release.
